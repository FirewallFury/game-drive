# The game-drive project
A collection of games for running of a flash drive for android, raspberry pi, and more!

## How to install

### Android

First, you'll need the latest build of the game-drive image.
You can donwload it from the releases page, or build it yourself!

Once you have the latest build downloaded, install a disk flasher tool (balenaEtcher is recomended in this case.) and flash the .img file to any kind of flash memory! (USB Flash, SD card, ect.)
After the image is installed onto your medium, insert it into your device. (It should immediately begin the setup prosses by mapping every game file to the launcher app.)
